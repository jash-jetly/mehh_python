### 🤵 **Ramlal: The Original AI Assistant**

Before Siri, before Alexa, before Gemini... there was **Ramlal**.

But Ramlal is old school. He can bring the shawl, but cannot run a pc.
That's why Thakur upgraded to **Thakur Ke Haath** (this app).

## 🚀 Kya hai yeh? (What is this?)

This is a **Voice-Controlled AI Assistant** that lives on your screen as a transparent overlay. It listens to your commands and executes them using the power of **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**.

**No Hands? No Problem!** 
Just say *"Open YouTube"* or *"Create a folder named Gabbar_Ka_Adda"* and consider it done.

## 🔥 Features (Mast Cheezein)

*   **🗣️ Bol Bachchan (Voice Control):** Uses advanced VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to listen when you speak and stop when you're done.
*   **🧠 Dimag (AI Brain):** Powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash** - it understands context, not just keywords.
*   **👻 Gayab Mode (Transparent UI):** A beautiful glassmorphism UI that floats on your screen like a ghost (or Thakur's spirit).
*   **⚡ Tez (Fast):** Real-time transcription and execution.
*   **🛠️ Jugadu (Terminal Expert):** Can run any zsh command. It's basically a computer expert in your pocket.
