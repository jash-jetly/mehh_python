**Simple hai boss! He uses this app!** 🎤💻

Gabbar might have taken his hands, but he couldn't take his **Python skills** (and his Gemini API key). Now Thakur controls his entire Mac with just his voice!

## 🚀 Kya hai yeh? (What is this?)

This is a **Voice-Controlled AI Assistant** that lives on your screen as a transparent overlay. It listens to your commands and executes them using the power of **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**.

**No Hands? No Problem!** 
Just say *"Open YouTube"* or *"Create a folder named Gabbar_Ka_Adda"* and consider it done.
